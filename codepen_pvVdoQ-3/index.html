        <b>What is HTML and its Purpose</b>
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          <b>HTML</b> is an acronym for <em> Hypertext Markup Language</em>. Programmer's write code as HTML documents.  Basically code tells the web page what it is going to look like.
        <p> Computers have no idea what you want them to do unless you write programming code that tells it exactly what you want the web page to look like in the end result. The next, two sections will give a basic understanding of HTML vocabulary.</p>

        <b>Tags and Elements</b>
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
       <p>
        The HTML Markup consists of tags and elements.  Tags are contained within angled brackets.  On the keyboard they are the <em> less than "<" </em> and the <em> greater than >"</em> symbols. During the first lesson, the instructor used <a href="https://www.udacity.com/html_playground">the Udacity playground</a> for illustration.
      </p>
      <p>The opening tag, the contents within and the closing tag comprise the code <em> element</em>.

        <b>Attributes and the HREF</b>
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
        An attribute is a url reference within an element.  Three examples of an attribute would be a url that contains an image, a web site or a video within a web site. Whenever you look at a web site and it has images those images are attributes.  The programming code for image is <em> img src</em>.
      </p>
      <p>Sometimes when you read an article on the web it contains hyperlinks with references to other online articles.  These attributes use a programming attribute name called <b>href</b>.  So in programming the href is written as <em> <a href="https://www.udacity.com/html_playground">HREF= the web site link </em> <a> as the HREF for links.</p>

        <b>HTML Head and Body in Code Structure</b>
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
           When writing HTML code the programmer has to choose a software to write the code.  <em> Scratchpad.io</em> is a basic HTML editor for beginners. In order to write the code the programmer has to give a title to the item and classify what it is.
      </p>
        <p>The <b> body</b> of HTML is content.  So the writing we read in paragraphs would be considered body in HTML. Content is the contents of the document.</p>

        <b>HTML, CSS and Javascript</b>
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
           There are three, major dimensions to creating a web page. The HTML document is the structure of the web page.  Without an HTML foundation there is no web page.
      </p>
        <p>
         This structure consists of boxes that the programmer has to visualize when creating a web page. By looking at sections of a web page the programmer has to count the boxes so s/he can classify these boxes in her coding.
      </p>
     <p>The next dimension of a web page is <em> Cascading Style Sheets,</em> also known as <b>CSS</b>. Web pages have color, backgrounds, borders, fonts...this is the style of the web page.  CSS is written in a separate column from HTML and it tells the computer what artistic features to put on the page.</p>
      <p>Another aspect of a web page is Javascript. Interactive components of a web page are a result of Javascript. Web developers usually assign the changing elements of a web page, the Javascript, to one programmer.  More in-depth coverage of Javascript will be in future segments.</p>

        <b>DOM Tree-Like Structure</b>
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
       <p>
       According to Wikipedia, <b>DOM</b> "The Document Object Model (DOM) is a cross-platform and language-independent convention for representing and interacting with objects in HTML, XHTML, and XML documents.[1] The nodes of every document are organized in a tree structure, called the DOM tree. Objects in the DOM tree may be addressed and manipulated by using methods on the objects. The public interface of a DOM is specified in its application programming interface (API)."
      </p>
      <p>DOM is the elements of a tree.  HTML uses tags and these tags can be organized into a tree-like structure, which is DOM.  DOM is an absolute component in a programmer's organization of the HTML documents they create.</p>

        <b>CSS Inheritance</b>
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
        According to Wikipedia, "Inheritance is a key feature in CSS, it relies on the ancestor-descendant relationship to operate. Inheritanceis the mechanismby which properties are applied not onlyto specified element, but also to its descendants. Inheritance relies on the document tree, which is the hierarchy of (X)HTML elements in a page based on nesting."
      </p>
      <p>Programmers use <a href= "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference" >this web site </a> as their CSS reference. </p>

        <b>Embed CSS Stylesheet into HTML</b>
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
         <p>
      Within the HTML document, add a "head" tag at the top of your HTML.  Then add a "link" tag.  After "link" add the following: rel="stylesheet" type="css" and then href="main.css."

        <b>The Box Model</b>
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description"> 
     <p>In the box model, the center is content.  Surrounding content is padding, which is surrounded by border and then the border is encapsulated by margin.  In CSS the programmer has to determine box width, height, margin, border-width, and border-color. Sizes can be determined in either percents or pixels.

        <b>DRY: Do Not Repeat Yourself</b>
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p> As criteria for passing this phase of the project, the instructors want explanations as to why there should not be repetition in coding.<p>
        <p> According to Wikipedia, DRY, or Do Not Repeat Yourself "In software engineering, donâ€™t repeat yourself (DRY) is a principle of software development, aimed at reducing repetition of information of all kinds, especially useful in multi-tier architectures. The DRY principle is stated as 'Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.' The principle has been formulated by Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas in their book The Pragmatic Programmer."</p>
        <p> Repetitive programming code leads to monotonous patterns. The programmer limits herself from using the tools she has available to her. The end result will be a limited web page. Therefore, if the programmer challenges her skillset, then the web page itself will illustrate the programmer's code skill level.
